## Challenge 044
Read up on the [look-and-say](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Look-and-say_sequence) sequence. Create a program that will implement this sequence. Given an input of a starting sequence and number of generations, your program should output the resulting sequence using this pattern.

Example Inputs

starting sequence: 132
steps: 300
The output should be a really long string of digits based on calculating the look-and-say sequence starting with “132” for 300 steps.

## Installation

Install the vendor dependencies with Composer:

    $ composer install

## Usage

    $ php lookandsay.php <starting sequence> <# of iterations>
